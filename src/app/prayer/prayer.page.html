          Father God, my heart is filled with chaos and confusion. I feel as if
          I am drowning in my circumstances and my heart is filled with fear and
          confusion. I really need the strength and peace that only You can
          give. Right now, I choose to rest in You. In Jesus‚Äô Name, I pray,

          Father, today I ask forgiveness of all the negative and harmful words
          I have spoken about myself. I do not want to abuse myself in such a
          way again. Transform my thoughts and let me understand how marvelously
          you made me.
